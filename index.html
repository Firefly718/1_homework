                    <p>I have a bicycle. It's a mountain bike, but it's looks like a bmx, because it height is middle or below. But it does not stop me. I like ride on my bike, because with my bike I can to overcome a long distance in short time. With this bike you can to do something useful tricks. For example, you can tump over the curb or some other obstacle. But first you need to develop the skill. You need time for develope the useful skill.</p>
                
                    <hr>
                    <p>What I mean about enter into the phase? I mean that you can use your dreams for a lot things.</p>

                    <p>You can:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>to fly in your dreams with all feelings from real life, even if you don't have the experience;</li>
                        <li>to meet anybody in your dreams, even if somebody is dead or famous persona (in your dreams they are look live and maybe happy);</li>
                        <li>to feel new sensations;</li>
                        <li>be anybody (I mean some animals, humans or some more...)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>And it is no full list what you can in your dreams, when you sleep. Also, you can do it after sleep time or anytime when you want. But recomended to do this after your sleep time. In my experience I have more cases in middle dream time, but the most lucky was after my sleep time.</p>

                    <p>I like to fix some things. It may be my bike, headphones, pipelines, notebook code or something else. For headphonesI like to use soldering. I feel myself happy when my work has done correctly.</p>

                    <p>I like learn English, because I beggin to understand English language. It's my goal. Also I have others goals:</p>

                        <li>Travel to Phoenix, state Arizona;</li>
                        <li>To understand american native speakers;</li>
                        <li>To talk like a native american speaker;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>I like walk to the University and back to home. The distance from my home to the University is ~ 4.5 km. In total I walk about ¬±15 km a day. You can ask me: why you do it? I have an answer. This is how I fight physical inactivity. We sit and lie a lot. I think we have to more walk or stand on our feet.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>To try something new... I like when I mixed some styles in artwork, because I get something new and it's give me inspiration and I'm happy.) I try don't afraid to do new things. I understand that my mind don't have experience in some sphere of life, and I feel myself afraid something. So, I go to my fear and meet it. Because it</p>
